# Ruby2048

My own implementation of the 2048 game using Ruby.
It has the data model and a server that can run in a browser or as a command line server.
Soon, I plan to also include several bots that play the game.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ruby_2048'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby_2048

## Usage

To run the tests: rake test

To run the web server: rake server
